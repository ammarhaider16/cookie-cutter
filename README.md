## Cookie Cutter

Cookie Cutter is a Google Chrome extension powered by AI from Google Gemini to help users understand how active are the browser cookies on the pages they are visiting, what the cookies are doing, and whether they should be concerned about the cookies on the specific webpage, to enhance their understanding of privacy in their browsing experience. This extension also requires minimal permissions to carry out cookie analysis. Open the extension after adding it to Chrome and click the "Analyze" button to see what the browser cookies on a webpage you visit are doing!

## Technologies Used

Frontend Development: The extension’s interface was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically interact with webpage elements and provide real-time cookie analysis.
Chrome Scripting: Using Google Chrome’s scripting API, Cookie Cutter accesses active user cookies on any webpage. This allows the extension to retrieve cookie data with minimal permissions, ensuring user trust and security.
AI Integration with Google Gemini: Google Gemini’s AI capabilities analyze the functions of each cookie, generating clear and concise explanations about their purpose and potential privacy implications. This integration transforms raw data into actionable insights for users.
